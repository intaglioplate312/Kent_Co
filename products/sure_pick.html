    These reliable Ashley Sure-Picks are unexcelled in quality 
    and service. They are available in three sizes: Model SP-23, 
    SP-30 and SP-38. They will pick to perfection, fryers, fowl, 
    game birds and Turkeys. Ashley Machine Company has 
    been manufacturing quality poultry dressing equipment for 
    over 40 years, and feels that the Sure-Pick is one of the 
    leaders of their complete line of dressing equipment.</p>
  <p><br />
    The Feather Exhaust, a feature developed by Ashley, 
    helps the processor with feather handling problems. The 
    Automatic Unloading Door is self-closing. The door latch is 
    operated by the start button, which simultaneously starts 
    the timer and opens the automatic water valve. The work 
    shelf, feather exhaust, and automatic door are standard 
    features, however adjustable legs and catch table are 
    optional features for the SP-30 and SP-38 pickers.
