<p> Kent Company is one of the pioneers in the manufacturing of rubber de-feathering
fingers for use in your chicken or turkey processing machines. We have fabricated
poultry processing fingers in Chicago, IL since 1944, long before our competitors.</p>
<br />

<p>We are sure you will find that we are very competitive in our pricing, without sacrificing
quality, to produce high performance fingers of natural rubber. Our fingers are
molded weekly to customerâ€™s specifications to ensure freshness. They are also
packed in plastic bags to give fingers a longer shelf life.</p>
<br />

<p>We would be happy to quote you on our product line if you call us toll free at 1-800-521-4886, We appreciate your consideration and l look forward to working with you</p>
<br /><p>Best Regards,<br />
  Dolly Tomlinson-Sales<br />
